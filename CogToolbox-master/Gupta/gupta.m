% gupta(win, fgcolor, bgcolor, datafolder, subjno, playinglatency, recordinglatency)
%
% Performs the "Gupta task" (Gupta, 2003, QJEP) on window WIN with
% foreground FGCOLOR and background color BGCOLOR.
%
% Participants hear English pseudowords and immediately try to repeat them
% back.  The pseudowords are 2, 4 or 7 syllables in length.
%
% There are 5 blocks of 18 items each (90 trials total), plus 6 practice
% trials.
%
% Data take the form of recorded responses, saved in folder DATAFOLDER
% according to subject number SUBJNO.  Consequently, the data needed to be
% transcribed and scored offline after the task is run.
%
% The two latency parameters range between 0 and 1 control the timing of the sound
% files. Lower numbers result in more precise timing, but setting the
% number TOO low for your system may make the audio sound static-y.  See
% IndividualDifferences.m and the "Low-Latency Audio in Psychophysics
% Toolbox.doc" file in the CogToolbox for more information.

% 06.07.11 - S.Fraundorf - first MATLAB version.  thanks to Laurel Brehm
%                            for help.
% 06.09.11 - S.Fraundorf - enforce 1 s delay for accepting a response to
%                            move to the next trial, so people are less
%                            likely to hit the button before they finish
%                            speaking.
% 06.15.11 - S.Fraundorf - changed dot colors
% 06.17.11 - S.Fraundorf - fixed update to dot colors, clarified
%                            instructions
% 06.22.11 - S.Fraundorf - added initial warning to adjust volume.  reduced
%                            volume of materials (was very loud!) to match
%                            AdjustVolume.m
% 06.22.11 - S.Fraundorf - fixed bug in the new initial warning
% 07.03.11 - S.Fraundorf - resampled the audio to 48 kHz so it should play
%                            on PCs now
% 07.05.11 - S.Fraundorf - added latency parameters
% 08.12.12 - S.Fraundorf - improved stimulus timing
