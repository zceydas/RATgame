% [subjno listno] = getSubjectNumber(prefix,suffix,minnumber,maxnumber,numlists)
%
% Gets a subject number from the experimenter and checks to make sure it's
% valid and not already used.  If the subject number is invalid, the
% function repeatedly prompts the user until a valid number is obtained.
%
% Parameters PREFIX and SUFFIX specify the file prefix and suffix for the
% data files for your experiment.  e.g. if your files are
% myexperiment01.csv, myexperiment02.csv, PREFIX is 'myexperiment' and
% SUFFIX is '.csv'
%
% These are used to check to make sure that the subject number has not
% already been used.  If the subject number HAS been used, the user is
% asked if s/he wants to overwrite the file.
%
% If you want to store the files in a different folder than the current
% folder, this can be done simply by including the path as part of PREFIX:
%  e.g. PREFIX = 'datafiles/myexperiment'
%
% Optionally, a MINNUMBER and MAXNUMBER subject number can be specified;
% e.g. so that subject number must be at least 1 but no greater than 99.
%
% Optionally, you can also rotate through a set of lists and also get the list
% number for each subject.  Parameter NUMLISTS specifies the total number
% of lists for your experiment, which is used to rotate the subjects
% through lists.
%
% Note that this function does NOT open any files for output/input.  You
% still have to do that.  This just finds out what the subject # is going
% to be.
