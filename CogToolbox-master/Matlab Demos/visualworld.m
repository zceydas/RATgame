% This is a skeleton of code for a visual world eye-tracking experiment.
% You would then fill in the details of your experiment/stimuli/conditions.
%
% Type:
%   edit visualworld
% to look at the code
%
% If you use this as a basis for your experiment, please do File -> Save As
% to save this as a DIFFERENT file, instead of saving over the original base!
%
% This code is intended for use with the EyeLink-1000 desk-mount
% eyetracker.  If you're using a different eye-tracker, all the code for
% displaying images should be the same, but you would probably need to
% change the code that controls the eye-tracker.
%
% This demo will NOT run by itself.  It requires you to fill in the details
% yourself about YOUR experiment.  Please do not run your experiment until
% you've checked through everything and made sure that they match what YOU
% want in YOUR experiment.  I am not a mind-reader and cannot anticipate
% everything you might want to change :)
%
% This requires some basic knowledge of MATLAB and Psychophysics Toolbox to
% use -- check the other files in CogToolbox's Matlab Demos folder for
% help with that if you're new to MATLAB and PTB.

%% SETTINGS FOR EXPERIMENTER USE
% You must change these to match YOUR experiment!

% This line comes first to define the colors black & white and set up the
% random number generator:
InitExperiment;

% IMPORTANT: This statement should say test=0;  for real participants
test = 0;
%
% I get sick of reading the instructions every time I test my experiment.
% So, I put in a switch that allows me to skip over the instructions.
%
% Changing the above statement to test = 1; will cause the program to skip
% the sections that display the instructions.  This is useful for
% debugging.  BUT, you should be sure to change it back to test = 1; when
% you get ready to run real participants.


% These settings are the folders where the experiment looks for your lists &
% stimuli, and where it saves the BEHAVIORAL data.  (The eye movement data
% gets saved on the eye-tracking computer, of course.)
sound_dir = makeValidPath('C:/Documents and Settings/dwlab/My Documents/Scott/Cyclops/soundfiles/');
pics_dir = makeValidPath('C:/Documents and Settings/dwlab/My Documents/Scott/Cyclops/images/');
list_dir = makeValidPath('C:/Documents and Settings/dwlab/My Documents/Scott/Cyclops/lists/');
output_dir = makeValidPath('C:/Documents and Settings/dwlab/My Documents/Scott/Cyclops/output/');
%
% The behavioral data file is used if you want to analyze errors or RTs.

% This is the prefix for the behavioral data file (e.g. 'cyclops' if you
% want your behavioral data to be saved as
  % cyclops01.csv, cyclops02.csv, etc.
behav_prefix = 'cyclops';

% This is the prefix attached to the files that the eye-tracker generates.
% e.g. for my experiment called "Cyclops," I set the prefix to "cyc_" and
% the files were cyc_01.edf, cyc_02.edf, etc.
eye_prefix = 'cyc_';
%
% Number of DIGITS that will be in the subject number:
subjnolength = 2;
%
% !!! IMPORTANT: The eye-tracker runs in DOS and only likes 8-character
% file names.  That includes the subject number. 'cyc_43' is fine.
% 'cyclopsexperiment_43' is not.
%
% So, the prefix should be no more than 6 characters if you have a 2-digit
% subject number, or no more than 5 characters if you have a 3-digit subject number.
%
% This VERIFIES that the prefix is no more than 6 characters long, and
% quits if it's not:
if (numel(eye_prefix) + subjnolength) > 8
    fprintf('Prefix for eye-tracking file name is too long.\nIt should be 6 characters long at max.\nPlease fix this in your experiment and try again.\n');
    return
end

% Below is the number of seconds to wait between displaying your visual
% stimuli and playing your auditory stimuli.
% e.g. TimeBeforeSound = 1; means the pictures will be shown for 1 s before
% the auditory instruction begins.
% This can be 0 if you want no delay at all.
TimeBeforeSound = 0.25;

% This is the number of different lists you have.
NumLists = 1;

% This is the number of PRACTICE TRIALS you have.  The practice trials
% should be in the SAME list file as the rest of your trials, but at the
% TOP.  This setting is what tells the experiment that the first X number
% of trials are practice trials.
NumPractice = 1;

% If RandomizeOrder = 1, the program randomizes the order of the
% (non-practice) trials.  If RandomizeOrder = 0, they are always run in
% the order listed in the original file.
RandomizeOrder = 1;

% If you KNOW the frequency your audio stimuli were recorded at, and the
% number of channels (1 = mono, 2= stereo) you can set that here.
%
% If you DON'T KNOW, leave these at 0 and the experiment will try to figure
% it out from the sound files themselves.
%
% At any rate, you DEFINITELY want all your auditory stimuli to have the SAME
% frequency and SAME number of channels.
SOUNDFREQ = 0;
SOUNDCHANNELS = 0;


% Other settings you can change:
TextSize = 32;
TextFont = 'Arial';
bgcolor = white; % background color
fgcolor = black; % color of TEXT in the instructions screen
                 % and of the BORDERS around pictures
%
% If you want to use colors other than white and black, they need to be
% defined in terms of RGB values.  See my graphicsdemo.m for more info.

%% CHECK THE SCREEN RESOLUTION     

% The eye-tracker expects the monitor to have a particular screen
% resolution.  The display should be 1280 pixels wide x 1024 pixels tall.
%
% It's important to CHECK that this is the case.  The experiment will not
% work properly if the screen has a different resolution.
%
% The code below CHECKS the resolution of the screen.  If it's NOT at the
% right resolution, it forces the experiment to stop and displays a message
% about how you can fix it.
%
% This keeps the experiment from being run at the wrong resolution.

resolution=get(0,'ScreenSize');
if resolution(4)<1024 && ~test
    fprintf(['Please change the screen resolution to 1280 x 1024!\n'...
        'Quit Matlab, right-click on the desktop.  Go to "properties", '...
        'then "settings," and change the Screen Resolution to 1280 x 1024\n.'...
        'Restart Matlab after you have done this.\n']);
    return
end

%% GET SUBJECT NUMBER FROM USER

% Figure out the MAXIMUM subject number
if subjnolength == 2 % maximum length is 2 digits
    maxsubjno = 99;
else % maximum length is 3 digits
    maxsubjno = 999;
end

% The getSubjectNumber() functions prompts the experimenter for a subject
% number *and* verifies that the subject number HAS NOT ALREADY BEEN USED.
[subjno listno] = getSubjectNumber([output_dir behav_prefix], '.csv', 1,maxsubjno,NumLists);

% It also AUTOMATICALLY rotates through the different lists you have based
% on the subject number.  You don't have to worry about entering the
% correct list number.

%% DO EYE-TRACKING?

% I also like to ASK the experimenter whether or not to run the eye-tracker. 
% 
% Saying NO to eye-tracking allows us to run the rest of the experiment
% without having an eye-tracker connected & calibrated.  This allows you to
% test the experiment on your own personal computer, for instance.
% (Otherwise, if MATLAB tries to access the eye-tracker and it's not
% connected, the experiment will simply crash.)

% do eyetracking?
doeyetracking = -1;
while doeyetracking < 0
    userstr = upper(inputstring('Do eye-tracking in this session? (Y for Yes, N for No): '));
    if strcmp(userstr, 'Y')
        doeyetracking = 1;
    elseif strcmp(userstr, 'N')
        doeyetracking = 0;
    end
end

fprintf('Please wait - loading experiment... \n');

%% OPEN THE LIST FILES

% In this section, we load up a list of trials.  The list of trials is
% saved in a separate comma-separated spreadsheet (.CSV -- OpenOffice Calc or
% MS Excel can easily save in this format)
%
% Each trial is a ROW in the spreadsheet.
%
% The stuff that goes in your list file will depend on your experiment
% (e.g. what conditions you have).  Some things that it should DEFINITELY
% have are:
%  > the FILENAME of the AUDITORY stimulus for the trial.
%
%  > the FILENAME of the VISUAL stimuli for the trial - 1 column per port.
%    See below for more information on PORTS.
%
%  > the CONDITION that each port represents - e.g. does that port
%    represent the TARGET, the COMPETITOR, an EMPTY spot, etc.?  you should
%    have 1 column per port.  This is the stuff that gets sent to the
%    eye-tracker and is used to analyze your eye-tracking data (so make
%    sure that it is correct!)
%
%  > if the picture is being DRAGGED somewhere, the PORT NUMBER where the
%    the DROP LOCATION is
%
%  > probably, some other columns with condition information that you want
%    to keep track of.
%
% See the list1.csv that comes with the CogToolbox-3 for a brief example
% (NOT a full experiment, but hopefully enough to get you started)
%
% Because each experiment involves DIFFERENT variables, you will need to
% MODIFY this section of code to reflect what YOUR experiment requires.
% See below for what you need to change.
%
% Each LIST is a separate file.  They should be called list1.csv,
% list2.csv, etc.
%
% The PRACTICE TRIALS should come at the TOP of the list file.  At the top
% of the script, the line:
%   NumPractice = 1
% tells the experiment how many practice trials you have.  Change the
% number to properly reflect how many practice trials there are.


% Open the appropriate list of trials:
listfile = fopen([list_dir 'list' num2str(listnum) '.csv']);

% Read in the first line - this is the header row - and then discard it:
fgetl(listfile);
% If you don't have a header row at the top of your file (e.g. a row that has
% the name of each column), you should remove that line.


% !!IMPORTANT: THIS NEXT LINE MUST BE MODIFIED TO REFLECT THE NUMBER OF
% COLUMNS (and their CONTENTS) in YOUR list files.  See matlabbasics.m for
% more information on how to do this.

% Now, read in the DATA and save it in a big cell array (called
% 'trialdata')
%
trialdata = textscan(listfile,'%s%s%d%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%d', 'Delimiter', ',');

% Close the file after reading data;
fclose(listfile);

% !!IMPORTANT: THIS SECTION MUST ALSO BE MODIFIED TO REFLECT YOUR
% EXPERIMENT.
%
% This secton defines WHICH COLUMN to look in for each type of data.
% We use this throughout the experiment to look up stuff from trialdata.
%
% For instance, our ITEM NAME is in column 1:
%
% You will need to UPDATE this to reflect your own experiment:
ITEM = 1; % column where the ITEM NAME is
SOUNDFILE = 2; % column where the SOUND FILE is
ISFILLER = 3; % 1 if FILLER ITEM, 0 if CRITICAL ITEM
DISCSTATUS=4; % a column indicating an experimentally manipualted factor
ACCENT = 5; % another experimental factor
PORT_CONTENTS = 6; % number of FIRST COLUMN definining the PORT CONTENTS
    % (4 columns in total if you have 4 ports, etc.)
PORT_CONDITIONS = 10; % number of FIRST COLUMN defining the PORT CONDITIONS
DROP_PORT = 14; % this column has the PORT NUMBER where the participant should DROP a picture being moved



% If you requested the trials to be in RANDOM ORDER, this next section of
% code randomizes the order of the trials.
%
% Otherwise, the trials are presented in the same order they appear in your
% spreadsheet.
%
if RandomizeOrder    
   % YES, randomizing
   %
   % First, count how many NON-PRACTICE trials there are:
   realtrials = numel(trialdata{1})-NumPractice; % total trials - # of practice trials
    
   % Randomize the order of the real trials:
   realorder = randperm(realtrials)+NumPractice; % +N because the first ones are practice trials
   % This takes all the numbers from X to Y, where X is the first real
   % trial and Y is the last trial, and puts those numbers in a random order.
   
   % Randomize the order of the practice trials:
   practiceorder = randperm(NumPractice);
   % You can comment out the above line if you don't want the practice
   % trials to be put in a random order.
   %
   % This takes the numbers from 1 to N, where N is the number of
   % practice trials, and puts those numbers in a random order.
   
   % Now, concatenate these into a single list of trials, with the practice
   % trials coming first:
   trialorder = [practiceorder realorder];
else
    % NO, always the SAME order
    
    % Count the number of trials
    numtrials = numel(trialdata{1});
    
    % Present these as ordered:
    trialorder = 1:numtrials;
    % Here, the trial order is just the list of numbers from 1 to Y, where
    % Y is the last trial.  It's always in numerical order.
end

%% OPEN THE BEHAVIORAL OUTPUT FILE

% I save data about each trial and the participants' errors into a file.
%
% You could also use this to keep track of RTs or whatever else you want.

% open the output file
outfile = fopen([output_dir behav_prefix num2strLZ(subno, ['%' num2str(subjnolength) 'd'], subjnolength) '.csv'], 'w'); % w for WRITING

% Below we add a header row in the output file
%
% Printing the header row is optional -- but it makes your output easier to
% understand, and helps when importing data into R (so it knows the names
% of your variables)
%
% You'll probably want to change this to reflect YOUR experiment :)
fprintf(outfile,'SUBJECT,LIST,TRIALNUM,ITEM,ISFILLER,DISCSTATUS,ACCENT,TARGET_PORT,DROP_PORT,ERRORS\n');
%
% The ordering of the variables in the header row should reflect the order
% you print them at the end of each trial (in the code for each trial,
% far below).

%% SET-UP VISUALS

% Open the screen
[elwindow rect] = Screen('OpenWindow', 0, bgcolor);
% rect is a 4-element vector that contains the dimensions of the screen

% Set font properties
Screen('TextSize', elwindow,TextSize);
Screen('TextFont', elwindow,TextFont);

% If you have video driver problems, remove the % from the line below to
% activate it.  Otherwise, keep it commented out:

%Screen('Preference','VBLTimestampingMode',-1); 

% The next line is supposed to improve the smoothness of the graphics.  I
% haven't done too much testing of how much it actually helps, but it can't
% *hurt*
Screen(elwindow,'BlendFunction',GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);

%% SET-UP SOUND

% The next statement sets up Psychophysics Toolbox's sound system.  It is
% REQUIRED to have this at the start of your experiment.  See sounddemo.m

end

%% PORT SET UP

% In a typical visual world experiment, the screen is divided up into
% "ports."
%
% A port is a location in which a picture can appear.  For example, if
% each trial has 4 pictures, you have 4 ports.
%
% Each POSSIBLE location needs to be a port, even if nothing appears in
% that port at some times.  For example:
%  > You have 3 pictures per trial but 10 locations in which those
%    pictures could appear -> there are 10 ports.
%  > You have 4 pictures per trial, and 4 other locations to which those
%    pictures could be moved by the participant -> there are 8 ports
%
% The ports are defined in terms of 4 numbers.  The numbers, in order, define:
%   - the LEFT EDGE of the port
%   - the TOP EDGE of the port
%   - the RIGHT EDGE of the port
%   - the BOTTOM EDGE of the port
% in terms of PIXELS.  0s correspond to the top and left corner of the
% screen.  Increasing the #s will move the picture further to the right and
% further down.  See graphicsdemo.m for more information about how graphics
% are displayed in Psychophysics Toolbox.

% Define the ports
ports         = [left_x_coordinate top_y_coordinate right_x_coordinate bottom_y_coordinate; ... % coordinates defining port 1
                 left_x_coordinate top_y_coordinate right_x_coordinate bottom_y_coordinate; ... % coordinates defining port 2
                % ... and so on...
                left_x_coordinate top_y_coordinate right_x_coordinate bottom_y_coordinate]; % coordinates defining LAST port

% You will need to change these to the coordinates that you want your ports
% to have.  For example:
%   ports      = [100 200 300 500;
%                 400 700 600 1000];
% would define two ports.  The first port starts at pixel X:100,Y:200 and
% goes to pixel X:300,Y:500.  The second port starts at pixel X:400,Y:700
% and goes to pixel X:600,Y:1000.  Both ports are 200 pixels wide, and 300
% pixels tall.

% You could type in every number manually.  Or, you could some sort of
% calculation, e.g.:
%     100 300 100+portwidth 300+portheight
% where you previously defined portwidth and portheight to be some numbers
%
% If you want to refer to the screen size, rect(3) is the total width of
% the screen, and rect(4) is the total height of the screen.  Thus:
%     0 0 rect(3)/2 rect(4)/2
% defines a port that occupies the entire upper-left quadrant of the
% screen.


% Calculate the SIZE of the ports (you DON'T need to change this code):
portRects = [zeros(size(ports,1),1) zeros(size(ports,1),1) ports(:,3)-ports(:,1) ports(:,4)-ports(:,2)];
%
% Each row represents 1 port and has the format:
%   0 0 width height
%
% Whereas "ports" represents the RAW COORDINATES of the ports, portRects
% represents their SIZES. We use this later to help with resizing & drawing
% images.

%% CREATE MASTER TRIAL DISPLAY

% Here, we create a "master" window for each trial, called "alltrialwindow"

alltrialwindow = CreateOffWin(elwindow, bgcolor, TextFont,TextSize);

% In some experiments, there are some common elements you might want to
% display on EVERY trial:
%  > For example, you might have a fixation cross that is permanently
%    visible in the center.
%  > Or, you might have a standard set of pictures that serve as GOAL LOCATIONS
%    (e.g. geometric shapes in the corners, so you can give instructions
%    like "Put the candle below the circle.")
%  > Other situations I can't think of right now :P

% alltrialwindow contains these repeated elements.  Anything you put on
% alltrialwindow (e.g. pictures, text, lines) in this section will show up on
% EVERY trial.
%
% Stuff that is UNIQUE to each trial (e.g. particular target pictures) should NOT
% be added here.  That gets done later, for each specific trial.
%
% If the display is going to be completely different on every trial (e.g.
% you just have 4 pictures that are different on every trial), then there
% is nothing you need to add below.

% -----USE THIS SECTION TO DRAW STUFF ON ALLTRIALWINDOW--
%   e.g. DrawLine, loadimage + CopyWindow, etc.
% -----END SECTION FOR DRAWING ON ALLTRIALWINDOW---------

% It's more efficient to draw these elements just once on a master window.
% Drawing them over & over on every single trial is slower.

%% SHOW INSTRUCTIONS TO PARTICIPANTS

% Here you show instructions to the participants detailing the experiment.
%
% The InstructionsScreen() function handles displaying a screen of
% instructions, and forces the participant to spend some time reading the
% instructions before they are allowed to click to continue.  This helps
% makes sure that your participants actually READ your instructions.
%
% Each pair of instructions=[] and InstructionsScreen() commands is a
% separate screen.
%
% You can insert paragraph breaks in your instructions with a pipe: |
% See below for examples.
%
% This set of instructions applies to an experiment I ran.  You will
% probably want to modify them to match your task!

if ~test
    
  instructions=['In this experiment, you will hear recorded instructions.  The instructions will tell you how to move pictures on the computer screen.|'...

%% RUN EACH TRIAL

% This large section is where your actual trials get run.
%
% Some people put their practice & experimental trials in separate blocks of
% code.  The experiment is essentially coded twice.  My version combines
% everything into one block, and just uses the "trialcounter" variable to
% keep track of whether or not you are in the practice block.  I prefer
% this because it means you need 1 set of code to run your trials.  It
% guarantees everything works consistently.  Otherwise, you might change
% something in the code for the practice block and forget to change it in
% the "real" trials, or vice versa.

% This next variable keeps track of the serial ordering of trials.  We use this
% to display some transition screens after the practice block. (The code
% for those screens is at the very end of this section.)
trialcounter = 1; % initialize trial counter

for trialnum=trialorder
    % trialorder is the list of trials, and we step through the list 
    
    % This stuff SETS UP each trial; we haven't displayed anything yet.
    
    %% DO DRIFT CORRECTION
    if doeyetracking
      % This does the drift correction (only if the eye-tracker is turned
      % on).  The drift correction helps the eye-tracker keep up to date in
      % case the participant's position has shifted slightly ("drifted")
      % over the course of the experiment.
      %
      % I do the drift correction before every trial, since it only takes
      % a few seconds (if that!).  If you have a LOT of trials and need to
      % make your experimenter shorter, you could consider doing the drift
      % correction only every few trials.  The easiest way to do this would
      % be with mod(trialcounter) -- see my demo in matlabbasics.m for more

    % "Screen: portnumber,condition;portnumber,condition..."

    % the CONDITIONS they represent, not the actual images.  Otherwise, you
    % will have a real pain later matching each image to the condition it represents.
    %
    % !!!EVEN MORE IMPORTANT!!!: The Screen statement CANNOT be more than 80
    % characters long.  This includes the initial "Screen: " text, and all the
    % text defining the port #s and pictures.  If you have a LOT of ports, you
    % might need to ABBREVIATE the names of the conditions

            % as rectangles, filling up the corners of the pictures with
            % whitespace (or whatever your background color is) if needed.
            % This means that when the pictures are dragged around, even
            % the corner whitespace can occlude another picture.  That
            % looks really weird.  If you add a border to the picture, it's
            % perceived as a rectangular object and the occlusion looks a
            % lot more sensible.
            %
            % (If this description is unclear, try commenting out the
            % FrameRect line and running your experiment.  The dragging
            % will look really weird.)
            %
            % If you're only having people CLICK on the pictures, and not
            % DRAG them, the border is unnecessary.
            %            
            % With Psychophysics Toolbox 3, it's also possible to avoid this
            % problem by making the "whitespace" TRANSPARENT using an alpha
            % channel.  I haven't played around with this too much, though.

    %% DISPLAY THE VISUAL STIMULI

    % instruction is finished.  When participant see the mouse cursor is on
    % the screen, they think they can click on stuff, and get
    % frustrated/confused when it doesn't work.  Hiding the mouse cursor
    % keeps people from trying to respond until the instructions are over
